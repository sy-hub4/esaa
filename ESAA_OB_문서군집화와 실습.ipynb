small side .\\n15                                                                                                                                                                                                              However, parking is $30 night and valet only, which becomes a pain .\\n16

                                                                                                                 room was quiet, clean with good beds but very very smallnot a cheap hotelvalit parking was to much expencive but oke its the location\\n18                                                                                                                                                                      Parking is crazy expensive, we drove up from LA so we had a car ,  but otherwise, you really don't need it .\\n19                                                                                                                                                                                                      Parking is expensive   and everything is very much within walking distance .\\n20                                                                                                                                             Valet parking is, in my view, unreasonably high at $38 per night, but again we knew this before we arrived so can't really complain .\\n21                                                                                                                                  As most hotels in the city, parking is expensive so unless you really need a vehicle it\\u0092s cheaper to just buy a MUNI Passport during your stay .\\n22                                                                                                                                                                                  The hotel does have parking, but it is expensive and hard to get around the city while driving .\\n23                                                                                                                                                                  The parking was steep  , so if I had to do it again I would have parked 1 2 block north for about half of that .\\n24                                                                                                                                                                                              Parking at $45 a night was outrageous, but probably worth it to keep your car safe .\\n25                                                                                                                                                                                                                               We did not have a car, hotel parking is expensive .\\n26                                                                                                                                                                                          The valet parking was very convenient and seemed secure as it is attached to the hotel .\\n27                                                                                                                                                                                       A lot of hotel parking garages lots are not on the same premises as the hotel in the area .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                                            First, the biggest &quot gotcha&quot  is the mandatory valet parking .\\n29                                                                                                                               Not trying to bad mouth the Tuscan, it is a nice place to stay, and if you're not put off by the valet parking, you shouldn't be too disappointed .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                              Valet parking for $40 per night seems a bit steep,but at least the service was efficient and quick .\\n31                                                                                                                                                                          The prize for vallet parking is steep but I think you can expect that anywhere you go in San Francisco .\\n32                                                                                                                                                     Valet parking was $45 per night with tax, but that includes in and out privileges and my car was there whenever I needed it .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Watch out for steep parking rates of about $45 per night .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                                              This total includes the taxes and tips for mandatory valet parking .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Aside from the parking rate, you won't be disappointed .\\n36                                                                           The other thing that I found disappointing was I can't remember the exact details but something like the charge they quote for parking   was even more than that because there was some sort of a tax .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Onsite parking is available .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                             I called before we ever arrived to inquire about it and was told that parking was no problem at all .\\n39                                                                                              I guess calling to inquire about parking while giving them our name and reservation dates didn't warrant the clerk to inform us that we should make a reservation for our car also .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                                                            Valet parking is provided at $36 day which was, I thought, excessive .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                Walgreens has same souvenirs the airport shops do for 1 2 $Do not rent a car, waste of time, money,   no parking !\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                              The valet parking was overpriced, the service was terrible, and the coffe was cold .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          At the hotel, it is valet only parking .\\n44

                                                                                                                                                                        I do think that if you are staying at a hotel you should not have to pay for parking .\\n46                                                                                        The hotel, located a few blocks from Fisherman's Wharf as well as Ghiardelli Square, has a nice Italian theme that carries into the lobby as well as the uniforms for the parking valets .\\n47                                                                                                                     Speaking of parking, you're going to have to pay and it's going to have to be valet service, as there are no free self park lots that are part of the hotel .\\n48                                                                                                     Not only is it pricey at $36 day, but having nothing but valet parking means you have no access to your car unless you have one of the valets fetch it from the lot for you .\\n49   Although our room was indeed non, smoking   and we had a king size bed we ended up on the 3rd floor and our room, facing Mason Street, overlooked a concrete multi, story parking lot although if you stood at the window you could see the Coit Tower which was a nicer view !\\n50                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Several have mentioned the charge for parking .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                     It really does save if you can get a deal with free parking, but the fee is not out of line .\\n52                                                                                                                               Valet parking was $36 a day, but we're not complaining because other SF wharf hotels have charged us a similar fee even without the valet

too much money to pay for parking, but that is the way it is in San Francisco .\\n64

Parking at the hotel is expensive at $32 plus tax per night but the up side is that you have in out privilages .\\n67

the market price in San Francisco, or as the locals like to call it :\\n69                                                                                                           I notice on other reviews the high cost of parking which we didn't have to consider as we were advised you do not need a car to get around SF, and this is quite true .\\n70               All in all, the location was perfect ,  a short walk to the cable cars or bus lines, a Safeway grocery and Walgreens drugs is across the street in a parking garage, type mall, and there are small places to eat breakfast nearby plus an IHOP a few blocks over .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                               Parking at the hotel was a hefty $32 per day with unlimited in and out privileges .\\n72

expensive than we had been told ,  $35 day ,  which seemed very high .\\n74                                                                                                                                                                          Because of the exhorbitant $29 valet parking fee, we only rented a car for Sonoma and Napa for one day .\\n75

hadn't gotten our luggage out of th car and the valet wanted the keys .\\n79

  Note to those with a car, overnight valet parking is $26 but right next door the car park is $15 and it takes about 30 seconds to get from your car back to the hotel ,  why pay $26 ?\\n88

all good, albeit a bit stoic .\\n32                                                                                                                                            Unfortunately we didn't get to dine in the hotel restaurant, but I'd say it would be good, if the after hours service is anything to go by !\\n33

.\\n34

staff at the front desk could not have been more helpful and whilst we did not avail his services, the concierge always seemed to be busy with guests giving info and advice .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                         There was also a gentleman offering massage at this time and we met a few people who had enjoyed his services .\\n37

                                                                                                        This was probably not the best pick for us as we don't like tourist areas and Fishermans Wharf if one big tourist service .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                               There are many public transportation options including the cable cars, the trolley line and bus service .\\n40                                                                                                                                                  The highlight of this hotel for us was the service offered by the staff, particularly the two concierges on duty while we were there .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                                                       Their service was of the level and knowledge I would expect at at 5, star hotel .\\n42                                                     One day we had the do not disturb sign on the door before the maid had come so we could rest, and when we finally stepped out for about an hour, we changed the sign for maid service and everything was perfect when we returned !\\n43                                                                                                            Amenities ,  While this hotel isn't a luxury property, they have some nice touches like marble bathrooms, mini bar, room service and an evening wine reception every day   .\\n44                                                                                                               At this point I asked to be put through to Best Western Customer Services and amazingly our room was changed to a king bed suite as per our reservation within the hour .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                       They state that there is an obligatory service charge for tables of more than 6 .\\n46                                                                                                                             We dined as a party of 4 and were still hit with this and then the waitress failed to hand over $10 of change taking this as an additional service charge .\\n47

                                     The concierge service is second to none .\\n49                                                                                                                                          Tuscan Inn has it all, exellant location,very close to public transport, very clean, impeccable, friendly service and a supermarket opposite .\\n50                                                                                                                                               We found a great breakfast place just around the corner in Taylor St, called Darren's Cafe, good prices with excellant food and service .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                    Valet parking for $40 per night seems a bit steep,but at least the service was efficient and quick .\\n52

friendly service .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                          The hotel makes a big thing of the coffee bisc service in the morning,and this is quite nice .\\n54



                                                       Overall, the stay at The Tuscan Inn was great and would highly recommend due to the room service .\\n57

overpriced .\\n60                                                                                                         Lunch and dinner room service is provided by North Beach Pizza, which

                                However, there are countless restaurants of all sorts and price ranges within a 1, 4 block walk of this hotel, there is little reason to order room service .\\n62

did not eat at the hotel restaurant, we chose to eat at the IHOP around the corner for breakfast and it was good food and service, and they are open 24 hours .\\n64

and he knew nothing about how to arrange the service .\\n110

premises as the hotel in the area .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                                            First, the biggest &quot gotcha&quot  is the mandatory valet parking .\\n29                                                                                                                               Not trying to bad mouth the Tuscan, it is a nice place to stay, and if you're not put off by the valet parking, you shouldn't be too disappointed .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                              Valet parking for $40 per night seems a bit steep,but at least the service was efficient and quick .\\n31                                                                                                                                                                          The prize for vallet parking is steep but I think you can expect that anywhere you go in San Francisco .\\n32                                                                                                                                                     Valet parking was $45 per night with tax, but that includes in and out privileges and my car was there whenever I needed it .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Watch out for steep parking rates of about $45 per night .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                                              This total includes the taxes and tips for mandatory valet parking .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Aside from the parking rate, you won't be disappointed .\\n36                                                                           The other thing that I found disappointing was I can't remember the exact details but something like the charge they quote for parking   was even more than that because there was some sort of a tax .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Onsite parking is available .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                             I called before we ever arrived to inquire about it and was told that parking was no problem at all .\\n39                                                                                              I guess calling to inquire about parking while giving them our name and reservation dates didn't warrant the clerk to inform us that we should make a reservation for our car also .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                                                            Valet parking is provided at $36 day which was, I thought, excessive .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                Walgreens has same souvenirs the airport shops do for 1 2 $Do not rent a car, waste of time, money,   no parking !\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                              The valet parking was overpriced, the service was terrible, and the coffe was cold .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          At the hotel, it is valet only parking .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Check for Internet deals and don't pay for their parking .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                            I do think that if you are staying at a hotel you should not have to pay for parking .\\n46                                                                                        The hotel, located a few blocks from Fisherman's Wharf as well as Ghiardelli Square, has a nice Italian theme that carries into the lobby as well as the uniforms for the parking valets .\\n47                                                                                                                     Speaking of parking, you're going to have to pay and it's going to have to be valet service, as there are no free self park lots that are part of the hotel .\\n48                                                                                                     Not only is it pricey at $36 day, but having nothing but valet parking means you have no access to your car unless you have one of the valets fetch it from the lot for you .\\n49   Although our room was indeed non, smoking   and we had a king size bed we ended up on the 3rd floor and our room, facing Mason Street, overlooked a concrete multi, story parking lot although if you stood at the window you could see the Coit Tower which was a nicer view !\\n50                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Several have mentioned the charge for parking .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                     It really does save if you can get a deal with free parking, but the fee is not out of line .\\n52                                                                                                                               Valet parking was $36 a day, but we're not complaining because other SF wharf hotels have charged us a similar fee even without the valet service .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Another irritant was the crazy parking fees for the hotel .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                  They do a good job and are a heck of a lot cheaper than a cab and you won\\u0092t have to mess with the parking fees .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   When I got a GREAT deal $99 INCLUDING parking !\\n56

steal .\\n58                                                                                                                                      We stayed at the BW Tuscan Inn only because they were offering a great winter deal , $99 for a room with king, size bed and free parking   .\\n59                                                                                                                                                          Overall, we would recommend this place to friends, especially if they are able to get a good discount and free parking .\\n60                                                                                                                                                                                                           Nice rooms, a bit on the smaller side, but parking right at the hotel .\\n61                                                                                                                                                                                    staff were helpful although the valet parking and the laundry costs were extremely expensive .\\n62

.\\n63                                                                                                                                                                                               Way too much money to pay for parking, but that is the way it is in San Francisco .\\n64

the market price in San Francisco, or as the locals like to call it :\\n69                                                                                                           I notice on other reviews the high cost of parking which we didn't have to consider as we were advised you do not need a car to get around SF, and this is quite true .\\n70               All in all, the location was perfect ,  a short walk to the cable cars or bus lines, a Safeway grocery and Walgreens drugs is across the street in a parking garage, type mall, and there are small places to eat breakfast nearby

expensive than we had been told ,  $35 day ,  which seemed very high .\\n74                                                                                                                                                                          Because of the exhorbitant $29 valet parking fee, we only rented a car for Sonoma and Napa for one day .\\n75

                                                              The highlight of this hotel for us was the service offered by the staff, particularly the two concierges on duty while we were there

the maid had come so we could rest, and when we finally stepped out for about an hour, we changed the sign for maid service and everything was perfect when we returned !\\n43

with this and then the waitress failed to hand over $10 of change taking this as an additional service charge .\\n47

good prices with excellant food and service .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                    Valet parking for $40 per night seems a bit steep,but at least the service was efficient and quick .\\n52

        The hotel makes a big thing of the coffee bisc service in the morning,and this is quite nice .\\n54

                                However, there are countless restaurants of all sorts and price ranges within a 1, 4 block walk of this hotel, there is little reason to order room service .\\n62

did not eat at the hotel restaurant, we chose to eat at the IHOP around the corner for breakfast and it was good food and service, and they are open 24 hours .\\n64

.\\n74   The hotel is conveniently located to the shopping centre across the road, and we made use of this to purchase our breakfast requirements, as we had not had great service from the adjoining

When we finally found the church later, the service times she had given us were wrong, too .\\n87                                                                                                                           Speaking of parking, you're going to have to pay and it's going to have to be valet service, as there are no free self park lots that are part of the hotel .\\n88

inside the tunnel .\\n7                                                           Acquiring satellites is very fast though if you are moving while the acquisition is taking place it will take a little longer to acquire a satellite and of course on a overcast day you may experience difficulty acquiring a signal though understandable .\\n8

less, the other 10% is due to the above events .\\n9                                                                                                                                                                 And it is very fast locating satellites, the new interface needs some time to get used to, it is very cool now you can drag the map with your fingers !\\n10                                                                                                                                                                                                                            It is quick in picking up satellite signals and very responsive with the user interface   .\\n11

encountered I guess it loss contact with the satellites due to interferrence by the tall buildings arroung .\\n13                   Can pay like $200 or something and get the service for life, HotFix which allows it to get satellites much faster when booting up this is a great feature and my only complaint about past Garmins that I used which was that it took too long to acquire satellites, this eliminates that problem .\\n14                                                                                      by the time the main menu comes up after turning the device on it generally already has a full 100% signal from the satellites and it's ready to navigate, a beautiful crystal clear LCD widescreen, and tons of other features .\\n15

Satellite acquisition time is very fast, as is re, routing .\\n16                                                                                                                                                     It also has a  hot fix  which finds satellites faster ,  which is very useful for starting your trip immediately and great for recalculating routes very quickly .\\n17

                                                                                      On a major highway leading into downtown it lost all satellite coverage and told me to make a U, turn on the 6 lane highway !\\n19                                                                                                                                                                                                         If the  hot fix  satellite performance is supposed to be fast, I'd hate to see the older versions without it .\\n20

                                                    It takes a little while to get the satellites sometimes, but I just set it up as soon as I get in the car and by the time I'm out on the road and

the next time you turn it on, it can relocate them very fast .\\n54

                       Took a few minutes for the unit to link up with the satellite, but once that was done, it was a breeze .\\n58

255W   is a handy little device that provides excellent value, but more importantly spot on directions .\\n6                                                 While I recommend that you refrain from entering a directions request while driving your car, I note that some of the more impressive features of this GPS are literally one touch away, and so mounting the device close enough to you to activite a one touch feature would seem to be relatively important .\\n7                                                                                                       But leaving it on the seat next to you is likely to cause a few double takes because as comfortable as you think you're going to be just listening for directions, the fact remains that the graphics will attract your eyeballs like a moth to a flame .\\n8

                             but for the most part, we find that the Garmin software provides accurate directions, whereever we intend to go .\\n10

even better, especially in areas that you have just enough familiarity to be considered dangerous .\\n11

type in complete directions when it isn't necessary .\\n12                                                                                                                                       The only other annoyance of any time is that if you deviate from your route and don't indicate that you are detouring, you get to hear the Garmin repeatedly chastize you because it has to recalulate your directions .\\n13

Gap Road exit, like the highway sign says, or like I would verbally tell someone to take if giving them directions .\\n33

those directions, I can look at the screen to see the exit I need to take .\\n34

                                                It lost satellite contact a couple of times on the trip   but apparently picked them up again because there were no skipped directions .\\n36

software interface side would be its inability to show 1, way streets on your overhead map   and that this particular model does not support the Garmin routing feature that you can sync between your PC and their more expensive models to pick multiple waypoints instead of just a point 'A' to point 'B' directions system .\\n42

from the program, and Google Maps has features that work with Garmin units .\\n43                                                                                                                                         Any time you're facing a closed roadway or are terribly stuck in highway traffic, you'll get a very slick change in directions to your destination given to you in literally less than 5 seconds than you ask for it .\\n44

that FM updates can confuse the device and changing directions after the obstruction has been cleared is not a good option .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                        I like being able to select different voices, however when I am using Daniel with the English accent, he seems to be clearing his throat at the end of his directions .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            It loads quickly, have pretty accurate directions, and can recalculate quickly when I miss a turn .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                                        Often when I'd get a phone call or was talking to someone, it would have been nice to just have the ability to quickly make the voice directions mute .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The directions were pretty right on, with a brief glitch with the distance it was calculating for some approaching streets .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                     I am sure I've not even touched upon the many features this GPS boasts, but for basic travel directions for the non, techie then this is a great product .\\n56

plot a course using a mapping Web site and recite the directions .\\n57                                                                                                                   Daughter Dearest now carries the Nuvi in the glove box of her car, pulling it out, plugging it in, and getting directions whenever she needs, in a manner that notably is much faster and clearer than reading a map or calling her mother .\\n58

                                                                                                                                                                                                                           There are different voices you can choose to give you your directions, even Australian, American and British English .\\n60

   I mainly bought the first one for my wife since she needs directions alot of the time .\\n61

the wedding were following me for directions .\\n62

.\\n63                                                                                                                                    The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .\\n64

this model which I chose for its ability to adjust the directions if you reroute, text to speech feature and 4 .\\n65

your route in seconds .\\n67

                                                               I was so tired of having to go to Mapquest and print out directions .\\n69

turn, by, turn directions with amazing accuracy .\\n71

directions .\\n72

years ago rather than spend a lot on maps and wasting time asking directions, especially in relatively remote areas of ME .\\n74

2 weeks driving around the Mid, West following Mapquest maps and directions .\\n75                                                                                                                                             I chose small towns as destinations and it always led me there without any problems, thus allowing me to enjoy the scenery of the fall foliage without worrying about using a map for directions or getting lost .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I use the map feature when I don't need directions which makes it easier to identify streets when street signs are obscured or missing  .\\n77

                                  On the negative side, the directions it gives to a given address are not always the best way to get there .\\n78

Kindle on Amazon's Marketplace, craigslist, wherever .\\n2    Before purchasing, I was obsessed with the reviews and predictions I found online and reading about some of the critiques such as the thick border, the lack of touchscreen, lack of battery SD slot, lack of a back light, awkward difficult keyboard layout, minimally faster page flipping, and the super, high price .\\n3

.\\n13                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Konrath are offering novels at prices ranging from $1 to $2 dollars, as a way to find new readers .\\n14                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     00, so the price of Kindle effectively dropped to $349 .\\n15                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Savings trump purchase price with Kindle's low book price advantages .\\n16                                                                                                                                                     I would have been glad to have paid any price to have had a book reader that was easier to read for myself with 20 20 vision and especially for the low, vision reader .\\n17

differences eg .\\n18

and may be less than you will find on other e, book sites .\\n20

                                                                                                                                                                                                         the BUT comes in and applies to the fact that the price for the downloads has been going up and up .\\n22                                                                                                                                                                                                 since the cost of the kindle is high anyway, the benefit, other than easy storage, was the reduced price of book downloads .\\n23                                                                                                                                                                                 The lack of such an obvious and necessary feature, especially considering the price of the device, really degrades its value and usability .\\n24                                                 I want you to know that ultimately, however, if I want a Kindle I will have to capitulate and accept Amazon's terms because Amazon has a monopoly over their own machine, and I will have to purchase one even at prices I believe are needlessly high for e, book readers .\\n25                                                                                                                                                                                And I know for sure that many print publishers will see this as an opportunity to provide attractively priced paper books as an alternative .\\n26                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  At the steep price of this device we should get better quality components .\\n27                                                                                                                            To have this continuous, high speed, wireless connectivity without the need for a physical computer to upload download onto is truly amazing and makes the price of the Kindle truly irrelevant .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                     price  , and intuitive operation your parents and grandparents can operate this device, if you are fortunate enough to still have them !\\n29                                                                                                                                                                               As a teacher, I really wanted this machine and have been waiting for the price to drop so that I could give myself the excuse to purchase it .\\n30

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The price for new hardbacks on the Kindle is great too .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               After reading the reviews and pondering the price all day, I took the plunge .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                             The ability to plug in headphones and play Miles Davis to drown out the screaming kid while you are reading at the doctors office is priceless .\\n34                                                                                                                                                       If you are searching for a REAL review on the Kindle 2 by someone that was waiting to receive it rather than complaining about price or other issues then here it is .\\n35                          However, I will say, the selection of inexpensive books has been worth the purchase price of this item  especially for those that enjoy reading the classics or nationwide news, it has been a joy to purchase entire collections for a fraction of the cost of purchasing new or even used books .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                                           Those in college, with children or just have a love of reading will likely find the convenience and savings well worth the price .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I found many simply by doing a search on genre's of interest with price  low to high  as a default .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     To justify the purchase price, those functions really need to be there .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The price of these 'classic' titles is pretty hard to beat, too .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                            I was a little miffed when i saw that they would now be charging for the Kindle cover, which was included in the price for the previous version .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                              Mind you, it's the same size as the Kindle 1, and that of most book pages, but I for one dream of something larger without a larger price tag .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                                 If I have to spend the full puirchase price on the K2 with a K1 still in hand I would have probably waited .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Although pricey, the real value of this purchase is that it got me to read again .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                        But, as far as my reading experience with the kindle 2, I have downloaded so many books and all at a fraction of the original price .\\n45

price goes down .\\n46                                                                                                                                            Yes, it costs extra, but they lowered the price on the Kindle 2 so that buying the basic cover costs plus the purchase price of the device itself equals the cost of a Kindle 1 .\\n47

apartment here in the City, I didn't mind paying the current price .\\n48

                                                                                                                                                                       Some people may find this an inconvenience, but I think it is just a small price to pay for delayed convenience especially where I am located .\\n50

     Books are retardedly pricey .\\n51

                       Even if you want to , I think it is way too pricey .\\n53

.\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Though it would be nice if the cover was included in the K2 price, it is still worth buying .\\n55

a year due to the low cost of most books .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                                The price of the device itself is the only drawback but if your an avid reader like myself the reward far outways the price .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                                                        The price, tag is pretty hefty for most people, though I would counter that the value proposition makes up for it   .\\n58

down .\\n59

significantly so, while 5 were not available on B&N at all .\\n61

             I checked the difference in price between the cheapest print available of the books and the Kindle Editions .\\n68

OK  , but not as good as Honda advertises .\\n50

             I had tons of room in my 4Runner, but I needed something that would get better gas mileage w o giving up power .\\n52

it should be driven, gas mileage isn't the best .\\n55

                                                         The Accord is better than other those car on gas mileage and reliability .\\n57

is horrible too, 20 mpg city highway after 6000 miles .\\n60                                                                                                                                       If you are looking for a car that is affordable and well built this is the car for you bad gas mileage\\n61                                                                                                                                        In reality we have been very disappointed our in city mileage is 16, 17 and highway is better at 27 .\\n62

                                                                                                                       I am sure as gas prices go up cars will be built to get better mileage at the expense of acceleration .\\n64                                                                                                                                     Good looking inside and out, comfortable and roomy, commendable performance, and excellent gas mileage .\\n65                                                                                                                                       I live in Chicago and drive downtown and back 2 times a week for school and am getting great mileage .\\n66

                                                                        Everything else such gas mileage, handling, stereo system is fine but it doesn't make up for the loud rattles and wind noise .\\n68                                                                                                                         It's almost embarrassing driving such a nice car around a parking lot and have it sound like a high mileage beater .\\n69                                                                                                                             So I saved $2 K upfront and will also save down the road since the 4 cylinder gets slightly better gas mileage .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                         It is a well built car that runs smooth and gets great gas mileage .\\n71

models .\\n73                                                                                                                                        Local mileage with the '08 has been about 24 mpg, and about 25 mpg with the '06's that we've leased .\\n74                                                                                                                                                              I decided to go back to Honda as even with high mileage they keep their value .\\n75                                                                                                                          Mileage ,  also not impressive ,  all I can get is about 24mpg, far from the 32 mpg you see on the window sticker .\\n76

                                                                                                                                      Gas mileage is fantastic especially going from a V8 SUV to a 4 cylinder sedan   .\\n78            I was tempted to go for the V6, but I drive 42 miles one way to work and we have an '07 Odyssey with the variable cylinder management system and unless you're on long highway runs it doesn't get the gas mileage Honda claims .\\n79                                                                       I just love this car ,  and with almost double the highway gas mileage that I was getting with my Grand Cherokee ,  that adds a lot of $$ towards my monthly payment .\\n80

                                                                                                                 It wasn't worth saving the little difference in gas mileage for this Honda .\\n82                                                                                                                   The gas mileage is about 45 to the gallon going on the highway with cruise at about 800 or 900 RPM and about 38 going 70 .\\n83                                                                                                                                                  The Gas mileage is good, the acceleration sometime is slow when cold from 1st to 2nd gear .\\n84                                                                                                                                                                                     I hope to get better mileage on extended highway trips .\\n85                                                                                                          I think the mileage would be even better with a 6, speed stick shift to drop the tachometer from ~2300 rpm to <2000 rpm at 60 mph .\\n86

            I am not known to drive slowly so I am pleased with the mileage .\\n89                                                                                                         We bought this car with the expectations of getting a car that feels good with my bad back, gets good gas mileage, and is reliable .\\n90                                                                                                                       So far, the reliability has been as expected, it is comfortable on my back, and the gas mileage has been pretty good .\\n91

possibly unsafe, and the 4 cyl engine provides inadequate power when challenged .\\n51

under varying conditions and actually experience transmission hesitations and the mediocre acceleration performance .\\n52

                                   Also worth mentioning is that this can be quite a 'conference' destination which can make things very busy if you are staying during one of these events  service can be slow and erratic, and the wait for elevators can be long and frustrating !\\n21

us about the attractions, and transportation services .\\n25                                                                                                                                                                    Overall, I think the Swissotel is a perfectly nice facility and I feel like we got a good deal but I would never consider paying full price to stay there as you can get the same amenities and service at lower rates elsewhere .\\n26

As I checked out I expressed my disappointment there were no biscottis and transportation service and the check out clerk tells me they do have the service and I needed to make an appointment .\\n20

                                         We had a discussion on the plane that it was such a shame that customer service was gone in so many companies these days .\\n22

go the extra mile to assist in anyway they can and the staff of the ajoining Cafe Pescatore are just as welcoming, with great service and the food is excellent .\\n29

in the hotel restaurant, but I'd say it would be good, if the after hours service is anything to go by !\\n33                                                                                                                                                      I'd highly recommend the Tuscan Inn based on location, cheerfulness of staff, aesthetics in the room and general overall service .\\n34

desk could not have been more helpful and whilst we did not avail his services, the concierge always seemed to be busy with guests giving info and advice .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                         There was also a gentleman offering massage at this time and we met a few people who had enjoyed his services .\\n37

service .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                               There are many public transportation options including the cable cars, the trolley line and bus service .\\n40                                                                                                                                                  The highlight of this hotel for us was the service offered by the staff, particularly the two concierges on duty while we were there .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                                                       Their service was of the level and knowledge I would expect at at 5, star hotel .\\n42                                                     One day we had the do not disturb sign on the door before the maid had come so we could rest, and when we finally stepped out for about an hour, we changed the sign for maid service and everything was perfect when we returned !\\n43                                                                                                            Amenities ,  While this hotel isn't a luxury property, they have some nice touches like marble bathrooms, mini bar, room service and an evening wine reception every day   .\\n44                                                                                                               At this point I asked to be put through to Best Western Customer Services and amazingly our room was changed to a king bed suite as per our reservation within the hour .\\n45

than 6 .\\n46                                                                                                                             We dined as a party of 4 and were still hit with this and then the waitress failed to hand over $10 of change taking this as an additional service charge .\\n47

                  The concierge service is second to none .\\n49                                                                                                                                          Tuscan Inn has it all, exellant location,very close to public transport, very clean, impeccable, friendly service and a supermarket opposite .\\n50                                                                                                                                               We found a great breakfast place just around the corner in Taylor St, called Darren's Cafe, good prices with excellant food and service .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                    Valet parking for $40 per night seems a bit steep,but at least the service was efficient and quick .\\n52

hotel makes a big thing of the coffee bisc service in the morning,and this is quite nice .\\n54

Did not eat at the restaurant, but room service was great .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                      Overall, the stay at The Tuscan Inn was great and would highly recommend due to the room service .\\n57

is conveniently located to the shopping centre across the road, and we made use of this to purchase our breakfast requirements, as we had not had great service from the adjoining cafe Pescatore for our evening meal and thought we would do our own thing each morning .\\n75

fact that Kindle 2 has no SD card capability and the battery is not user, serviceable is not an issue with me .\\n4                    Things like the buttons that made it easy to accidentally turn pages  the separate cursor on the side that could only select lines and was sometimes hard to see  the occasionally awkward menus  the case which practically forced you to remove it to use it and sometimes pulled the battery door off .\\n5                                                                                                                                                           The issue with the battery door opening is thus solved, but Amazon went further, eliminating the door altogether and wrapping the back with sleek stainless steel .\\n6                                                                                                                 Frankly, I never used either the card slot or changed the battery on my Kindle 1 but I liked that they were there and I miss them on the Kindle 2, even though, I have to admit, I don't actually need them .\\n7

port   .\\n8                                                                                                                  You can't carry an extra battery ,  though with the extended battery life and extra charging options it's almost a non, issue ,  and you can't replace the battery because of the iPod, like fixed backing .\\n9

there's no charge except battery power no pun intended !\\n10   Before purchasing, I was obsessed with the reviews and predictions I found online and reading about some of the critiques such as the thick border, the lack of touchscreen, lack of battery SD slot, lack of a back light, awkward difficult keyboard layout, minimally faster page flipping, and the super, high price .\\n11                                                                                                                                                                                As for the battery, Amazon's explanation was that it'd thicken the Kindle, so I'm fine with it b c the slenderness of the K2 is such a plus .\\n12

at 75% of full power .\\n13                                                                                                                                                                                                              I turned it on, noticed there was about a half a battery charge and proceeded to find my way around the thing .\\n14

have begun downloading whatever I wanted over the 3G Whispernet within seconds as the battery was charging,\\n17

work in some units .\\n38

                                                            There is a wall, mounted hair dryer in the bathroom .\\n40

that bothered me the most was the bathroom was very dated .\\n41

all .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Upon our arrival, there was a SLIGHT odor in bathroom but nothing worth complaining about .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The bathroom was adequate with thick, fluffy towels .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The bathroom was large and private .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                              The bathroom was very clean and well appointed with nice towels and toiletries, it was not big, but room enough to do what one needs to .\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Tuscan Inn room was quite nicely appointed, the bed was comfortable the chairs   TV adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .\\n47                                                                                                                                       my only real complaint would be that the bathroom does not have a separate vanity area, so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n48                                                                                                                     The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .\\n50   Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n51

                                               We may have had an ADA room because it was pretty big with large bathroom ,  it was room 459 ,  and the room had all the amenities we were looking for

in the bathroom had a crack in it, but it did not bother me enough to ask for a different room .\\n63

home because there was a website selling the shampoo listed on the bottle .\\n71

cracked, but window guards have fixed that, its a fun car to drive, and for what it is, its comfortable, controls are great, easy to reach, I'm looking forward to a lot of great miles with this car
